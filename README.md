## Lessons Learned

Relationships from the database and their importance, how to query data, manage users and save their data, sessions, cookies, responsive design, get and post requests using Python3 and Java Script.
Some challenges I faced were getting the relationships many to many, making the sidebar animated with effect on background in the main html.
Overcoming some with advisor help and others reading and scrapping around the web and documentation in Spanish, my native language.
